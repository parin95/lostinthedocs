<p>
	Hi, I'm Parin â€” a software engineer who's been building iOS apps for a while now. You'd think by this point I'd be cruising through docs like a seasoned explorer.
</p>
<p>
	But nope.
</p>
<p>Sometimes I get <i>very</i> lost in them.</p>
<p>
	This blog is my attempt to map the terrain as I go - not just for Swift, but for any technical concept I stumble on. Think of it as my learning journal for things that aren't immediately obvious (at least not to me), written in plain language with the goal of demystifying rather than just summarizing.
</p>
<p>ðŸ’­ What you'll find here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Concepts from the Swift book that made me pause and say "Wait... what?"</li>
	<li>Deep dives into tricky parts of the iOS ecosystem or related technologies</li>
	<li>Notes-to-self that might just save you a few hours of head-scratching</li>
	<li>Honest explanations, diagrams, code snippets, and the occasional meme</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever felt a bit lost in the docs too â€” welcome. You're in the right place.</p>
</Layout>
